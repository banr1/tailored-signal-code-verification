# Well-Behaved Function Overrides

`Override.WellBehaved pre fp f` specifies that a `State → State` function override `f` (see
`ElfRunsToWithOverrides`) behaves like a returning AAPCS64 leaf function that makes no system
calls. The process semantics do not assume it; callers supply `WellBehaved` proofs as review
evidence for override tables on whole-binary theorems.

/-- From every running state `s` with `pre s`, the override `f` behaves like a returning AAPCS64
    function without system calls:
    - `f s` updates only general-purpose and SIMD registers, condition flags (`pstate`), `fpsr`,
      memory, and sets `pc` to the entry link register `x30` (the caller's return address). Every
      other field (`sp`, `tpidrEl0`, `status = .Running`, `brk`, `fs`, `oracle`, `oracleIdx`,
      `exclFails`, `trace`, `symtab`, `sigActions`, etc.) is unchanged, including fields added to
      `State` later;
    - callee-saved registers are preserved (`CallingConventionPreserved`: `sp`, `x19..x28`, `x29`,
      `d8..d15`), while `x0..x18`, `x30`, flags, and other SIMD bits may be modified;
    - memory permissions are unchanged at every address (no mapping or `mprotect`), VMA anonymity
      is unchanged (`(f s).mem.isAnon = s.mem.isAnon`), and no new `lazyFree` markers are
      introduced (`s.mem.isLazyFree a = false → (f s).mem.isLazyFree a = false`);
    - every byte whose contents or `lazyFree` state changes lies in `fp s` and satisfies `canWrite`
      in `s`.
    Nothing is claimed outside `pre` (`WellBehaved (fun _ => False) fp f` holds for every `f`), so
    review `pre` and `fp`; the hook contract derived by `WellBehaved.hookOk` requires its
    precondition to imply `pre` and to own `fp`. -/
